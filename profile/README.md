# The Mummy
This is the Mummy Project organization.

## Working here
The first rule of working here is ***Be Nice, Be Respectful***

### The Structure
There is no hierarchy here. We operate a flat structure where everyone answers to the entire team. However, Leads are chosen to be responsible for things like merging and approving PRs.

Reach out to the entire Mummy Team when stuck. With the size of the team, someone will be able to help resolve your challenges.

Other things to note are.
+ All `main` branches are protected and cannot be pushed into without approving code reviews.
+ To push to the `main` branch, a pull request should be raised
+ Never commit `.env` or `.env.*` files. Create a `.gitignore` file and immediately these `env` files for git to ignore
+ Before you write anything, begin by writing unit tests.
+ Don't burn yourself out. Remember to have fun while also learning.

Have a wonderful time with us.
